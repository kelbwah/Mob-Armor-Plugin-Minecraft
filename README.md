# Mob-Armor-Plugin-Minecraft
This is a simple spigot plugin that makes it so that every zombie and skeleton spawn in with diamond armor. Just wanted to do this to test the spigot plugin with Java.
It was honestly a test plugin but if you want to use this as a base for any other server spigot plugins feel free to do so!


Use these links in order to start your spigot server and then you can download the .jar file and place that into the plugin folder of your server:

Look at the plugin.yml file in the repo to see all the available commands to enable the plugin in your server once you are in the game.
